# `tween_images`, gives you da images inn'tween!

Inspired by literally anyone who ever thought that linear interpolation
on images is going to be cool, only to discover that really, it's not
thaaat funny.

Triggered by this request in [`what-to-code`](https://github.com/joereynolds/what-to-code):
```tween_images(from_image, to_image, frames=5)```

Really, image recombination is only really fun if you throw
sophisticated algorithms at it and know what kind of result you want,
e.g.: seam carving, inpainting, outpainting, etc.

Also, it's a really stupid and slow implementation.  You really don't
want to use it for anything.

This code is really stupid and slow.  You really don't wanna use it in
production.  Go and write something faster as soon as you know what you
really want / need (which probably should be "yesterday").

If you really still wanna use this, go on, have fun:
